## 🚀 Future Ideas

Here are some improvements I’d like to add later:

- [ ] Add **trigonometric functions** (sin, cos, tan).
- [ ] Create a **GUI version** using Tkinter.
- [ ] Build a **web version** using Flask.
- [ ] Add **unit conversion** (cm → inch, kg → lbs, etc.).
- [ ] Add **history/logging** of calculations.
- [ ] Write **tests** to make sure all functions are correct.
